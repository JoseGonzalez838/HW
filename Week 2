                          		2.1.5 Section Review, Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
1. The central processor unit (CPU) contains registers and what other basic elements?
	• The CPU has registers, a Control Unit (CU), High-frequency clock, and arithmetic logic unit
	
2. The central processor unit is connected to the rest of the computer system using what three buses?
	• Data bus
	• Control bus
	• Address bus
	
3. Why does memory access take more machine cycles than register access?
	• The registers are implemented into the CPU, meanwhile the memory access has to be read
	and written to the CPU since it's not part of the CPU.
	
4. What are the three basic steps in the instruction execution cycle?
	• Fetch
	• Decode
	• Execute
	
5. Which two additional steps are required in the instruction execution cycle when a memory operand is used?
	• Fetch the operand
	• Store the result of execution
	
	
					2.4.3 Section Review, Question 5
5. What is the purpose of the 8259A PIC controller?

	•The 8259A PIC controller handles all hardware interrupts. In example, devices such as mouses, keyboards,
	clock drives, etc. have buttons that interrupt the CPU to process their commands immediately.
	
	
					2.5.2 Section Review, Questions 1, 3, 4, and 5
1. Of the four levels of input/output in a computer system, which is the most universal and portable?
	• The most universal and portable is the Application Program (level 3) because it is capable of working with other OS.
	
3. Why are device drivers necessary, given that the BIOS already has code that communicates with the computer's hardware?
	•The BIOS allows the computer communicate with the hardware it contains. Since device drivers are changing, the BIOS
	would not be able to keep up.
	
4. In the example regarding displaying a string of characters, which level exists between the
operating system and the video controller card?
	• BIOS function (level 1)
	
5. Is it likely that the BIOS for a computer running MS-Windows would be different from that
used by a computer running Linux?
	• No, because although they have different operating systems the BIOS would work for both.

					2.8 Review Question 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 19, 20, 25, and 26
7. Which part of the CPU performs floating-point arithmethic?
	• Floating Point Unit (FPU)
	
8. On a 32-bit processor, how many bits are contained in each floating-point data register?
	• 80 bits
	
9. (True/False): The x86-64 instruction set is backward-compatible with the x86 instruction set.
	• True
	
10. (True/False): In current 64-bit chip implementations, all 64 bits are used for addressing.
	• False
	
12. (True/False): Static RAM is usually less expensive than dynamic RAM.
	• False
	
19. (True/False): A bus is a plastic cable that is attached to the motherboard at both ends,
but does not sit directly on the motherboard.
	• False
	
20. (True/False): CMOS RAM is the same as static RAM, meaning that it holds its value without any extra power or refresh cycles.
	• False
	
25. At which level(s) can an assembly language program manipulate input/output?
	• Assembly language programs can choose form all the levels. Hardware (level 0), BIOS function (level 1)
	OS funsction (level 2), Application program (level 3).
	
26. Why do game programs often send their sound output diretly to the sound card's hardware ports?
	• They try to take advantage of the latest features in sound cards. That is why the send the output directly to
	the sound cards hardware.
