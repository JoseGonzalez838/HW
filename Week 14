 Which assignment took you the longest to complete?
 
 	- I would have to say the first assignment. Only because we were asked questions based on the readings we were 		assigned. It took time to go back and find answers but it was a simple assignment.
	
 Which assignment was the most difficult?
 
 	- The assignment I had the most difficulty was with assignment 7. It took me the longest to complete and had trouble 		running it.
	
 Which assignment was the easiest?
 
 	- Assignment 1 and 8 were the easiest. The only difference was assignment 1 was too long.
	
 Of the concepts we covered, which (if any) are you the most confused about still?
 	
	- I had trouble implementing conditional processing correctly. It may have been because of being so used to the 	simplicity of writing conditions in C++ that I had trouble doing them here.
	
 If we had an extra week to spend on any of the concepts covered in this course, which one would it be?
 	
	- I found the simple string encryption really interesting while reading the book and I found that would have been fun 		to look futher into because it could be a very useful tool.
	
 Were there any assignments you felt were unnecessarily tedious (not necessarily difficult, but that took too long to complete)
 	
	- Defintely assignment 1. That assignment took the most time to complete because trying to find the answers throughout 		the chapter was tedious.
	
 Which assignment was your favorite?
 	
	- The bubble sort assignment was my favorite because you get to see this done in other forms other than C++. 
	Also, I had to do a bubble sort for CIS 17C around the same time I wrote it for this class.
	
 Which assignment do you think you learned the most from?
 	
	- I think it was the first two assignments because I didn't know about assembly and how all the other languages are 	pretty much made from assembly language. 
	
 Were the assignment requirements and due dates clear enough? If not, how so?
 	
	- Everything that you wanted was clear enough. All instructions were said on every assignment and the due dates were 		very lenient especially because we had lab time to do them too.
	
 On a scale of 1-5, rate the difficulty (1=Breating, 5=Exiting Vim) of this course compared to other CIS courses you've taken.
 	
	- I would give it a 2 only because in some way it was like learning a new language. Once you get familiarized with it,
	it becomes similar to C and got easier.
	
 Was the book used in this course effective/helpful? Would you recommend a different one?
 	
	- I think the book we used was helpful because the way you taught the class was based in the book. I don't think i would recommend another book because it was easy to read at some points. Plus it was accesible by everyone.
	
 Were there any topics that we didn't cover that you would have liked to see included?
 	
	- I dont quite remember if we did go over the encription portion I mentioned above but if we didn't I would have 	wanted to see that.
	
 How can this course be improved?
 	
	- I think you did a great job and would have changed much about how you taught this course. I just wished there was an 		easier way to set or start a new project.
