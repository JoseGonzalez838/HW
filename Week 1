                                    1.1.3 Section Review, Questions 1, 3, 8, 12

1. How do assemblers and linkers work together?
    •	A linker combines files from an assembler (a program that converts assembly language to machine language) into a single program that can run.

3. What is meant by a one-to-many relationship when comparing a high-level language to machine language?
    •	A one-to-many relationship means that a single statement expands into multiple assembly language or machine 	instructions.

8. Do you suppose type checking on pointer variables is stronger (stricter) in assembly language, or in C and C++?
    •	In C++, you cannot allow a pointer of one type be assigned to another pointer of a different type. In assembly language, there is no such restriction.

12. Challenge: Translate the following C++ expression to assembly language, using the example presented earlier in this chapter as a guide: X = (Y*4) + 3.
         mov eax, Y
      	 mov ebx, 4
     	 imul, ebx
     	 add eax, 3
     	 mov X, eax


                                    1.2.1 Section Review, Questions 2, 3, 10
2. Why do you suppose translated programs often execute more quickly than interpreted ones?
    •	In translation, an entire program L1 can be converted into an L0 program without it having to be decoded like in an interpreted program.

3. (True/False): When an interpreted program written in language L1 runs, each of its instructions is decoded and executed by         a program written in language L0.
    •	True
    
10. Statements at the assembly language level of a virtual machine are translated into statements at which other level?
    •	Level 2
